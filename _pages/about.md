Hi! I’m Subba, an aspiring AI/ML researcher and a senior software engineer with a Master’s degree in Computer Science (AI/ML focus). I currently work at the University of Texas, where I help build and modernize enterprise-grade applications. Prior to this, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at UTRGV, following my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering. My background spans both research-driven ML projects and production-level system development.

Research
======
I am interested in the intersection of deep learning, foundation models, and multimodal learning, with a particular focus on how these models can be made robust, efficient, and deployable in real-world systems. 

My aim is to study multimodal learning methods that combine vision, language, and structured data, while grounding model design in system-level considerations such as scalability, monitoring, and reliability. I am particularly motivated by research that bridges theoretical modeling with real-world impact, and I am always happy to discuss ideas or collaborations in this space.
